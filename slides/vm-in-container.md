# VMs-in-containers

---

Why would we want this?

---

VMs are awesome, but...

They require infra like shared storage, and HA management services

---

My Lab: 

Hyper-Converged oVirt + Gluster

---

Enter Kubernetes

I get to thinking about *more* convergence...

---

---

A lot of it worked: 

Storage, Management, Authentication

---

Virtualization? 

Way too janky, so I punted...

---

Container-native storage has continued to progress

* Gluster CNS
* Ceph (Rook)

---

# KubeVirt

*an add-on that extends kubernetes to support scheduling of VM workloads alongside container workloads*

---

# KubeVirt Anatomy

---

Custom Resource Definitions

* New virt-specific object types added to the kube apiserver
* Manage like other kube objects, using kubectl

---

virt-controller

* A kubernetes operator
* Watches the apiserver for VM objects
* Creates pods for new VMs to like in

---

virt-handler

* One of these runs on every node
* Takes over the VM pod once the virt-controller creates it
* Starts up libvirt inside the pod

---

virt-launcher

* Each VM gets a virt-launcher pod
* This is the pod that the virt-controller creates initially, and the virt-handler takes over

---

storage

* pv volumes
* ephemeral volumes
* registry disk volumes
* cloud-init nocloud volumes

---

networking

* Regular pod networking
* Every kubernetes pod gets its own IP
* Expose ports with kube services

---
