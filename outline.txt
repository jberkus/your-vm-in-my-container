Introduction

Why?
  VMs-in-containers vs Containers-in-VMs
  large VM-based infrastructures, dev workflows
    not going away overnight
  VMs vs. containers
    VMs: more secure, HW assistance, resource pegging
    Containers: faster, smaller, but shared
    The security issue, particularly
      "picket fencing"
    Also resources, DB example
  The two basic use cases
    migration vs. security

KubeVirt
  Why?
    Transition to Kubernetes from VM infra stepwise.
    Use Kube to manage legacy VM apps
      Some of which require non-Linux OS,
      or specific Virt HW config
    Demo

Kata Containers
  Why?

    General arch to do this
